# The system map: what Effect4 is for, how it works, how it is organized

The authority for the frame: the goal, the layers and their owners, the sorts with their one
representation each, the kinds of arrow between them and what each owes. Written 2026-09-30 at
`be15b062`. It replaces the former `docs/core/ontology.md`, whose formal frame (its §5) is carried here and
whose dated 2026-09-17 sections are kept as history in
`docs/research/2026-09-17-ontology-and-do-now-probe.md`.

Status words: **proved** means a theorem at the trust ceiling `[propext, Quot.sound]`;
**exists** means code without that theorem; **open** means planned, with its decisions row.

## 1. The goal

An agent-first language of algebraic effects whose programs are first-order data. An agent
writes a program; a checker certifies its type or refuses with a located reason; a machine
defined in Lean runs it with every choice explicit, so a run replays exactly. The machine's
meaning is Effect's own: every behavior it models cites the line of the pinned Effect rc.112
source it transcribes. The same program reads from and writes to Effect TypeScript, and the same
machine compiles to native OCaml. Proofs connect each of these faces to the others, or the gap is
written down with its decisions row.

## 2. The layers

| Layer | What it is | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Programs as data | One program representation, `Eff`: a first-order tree with a digest, stored by content, printed and read back. Names are data; no closures, promises or runtime objects in program syntax. | §4 below; `AGENTS.md` vocabulary | exists |
| 2. Types and certificates | `Ty`/`EffTy` and one checker, a fold that certifies a type or refuses with a located reason; certificates by kernel decision. | `Program/Checker.lean`; `docs/core/traversal-census.md` | proved sound and complete against `HasTy` at every path; `explain = none ↔ wellTyped` |
| 3. Meaning | One denotation; a reference machine for proofs; the native (frame) machine for execution. | `docs/core/machine-state.md` | proved: meaning soundness; `run_eq_meaning` (straight fragment); `loopAgreement` (looped); `run_eq_ref` (the two machines, **empty host table only**) |
| 4. Choices as data | Every scheduling, timing and host-answer choice is a decision; a run's journal replays it. | `Run.lean`, `Api/Runner.lean` | proved: `replay_unique`, `journal_replays` |
| 5. The typed-state guarantee | A checked program never reaches a malformed state, and every fiber finishes at its type. | `docs/core/post-phase-c-synthesis.md`; `Laws/Program/Typed/` | slices 1–5 proved (world, admission, protocols, stack walk, delivery, assembly); M5–M7 open; statement repair (row 95) and value membership (row 96) open |
| 6. The host boundary | Host services are rows in a table. A program's call parks a fiber; the host answers through one keyed session that checks each reply and prepares it. | `docs/core/host-boundary.md` | exists: session, envelope, admission, preparation. Open: handle types (a live hole), the registry, lifecycle, the reference connection (rows 97–100) |
| 7. State and storage | The machine's state families, each owned by one of six storage interfaces with laws; facts fixed at creation in append-only ledgers; derived views, such as a handle's declared type, computed from ledgers and the checker. | `docs/core/machine-state.md` §7 | arena laws and `Projects`/`Refines` proved; interfaces, fork ledger and registry open (rows 91, 97, 101) |
| 8. Compilation | Three compilations: a program to the machine's first-order runtime code (`compileEff`); the Lean machine itself to OCaml through Lean's LCNF (OCaml is made only from LCNF); a program to and from Effect TypeScript. Each stage is a named connection with its own evidence. | `docs/core/lcnf-route.md` §8 | printer/reader laws and completeness over the template table proved; the OCaml engine checked by differential runs (finite); number policy mixed; rows 28/29/31 open |
| 9. Faithfulness to Effect | The pinned vendor source, the runtime census and its coverage report, the truth harness against real Effect runs, signed divergences (`U-01`). | `docs/RUNTIME-COVERAGE.md`, `docs/UPSTREAM-BACKLOG.md` | exists; coverage is quoted only from the report |
| 10. Authoring and use | A named authoring surface elaborated once into `Eff`; a certificate-first API; the MCP face after LCNF, by the owner's order. | `docs/core/api-surface.md` | exists in part; the agent authoring surface is the stated purpose |

**How the pieces connect.** A program comes in, from the authoring surface or read from
TypeScript. The checker certifies it. The machine runs it, reference for proofs and native for
execution, with explicit choices, and with host calls through the keyed session. The same machine,
compiled through LCNF, runs natively in OCaml. The printer writes the program back as Effect
TypeScript. Every arrow is one of the kinds in §5 with its obligation met, or it is listed as open.

## 3. Where it is going

1. **Slice 6's last item:** the fork ledger and the trace agreement
   (`docs/research/2026-09-30-origin-ledger-and-step-invariants-plan.md`; rows 91–94).
2. **The M6 statement repair and the value membership amendment** (rows 95, 96).
3. **M5–M7:** the typed-state guarantee on runs without host answers, a first and provisional
   result (row 99).
4. **The external lane** (`host-boundary.md` §6): the fiber slice first, then the Ref slice
   after generic cells.
5. **The first storage replacement** (row 85).
6. **The first real target closure** (rows 28/29/31).
7. **Composition** of the three (row 101).

The authoring surface and reading go alongside, and the MCP face comes after LCNF.

## 4. Sorts: one representation each

Each syntax sort has one owner, and its signature is data the generator reads.

| Sort | The one representation | Signature as data | Maps out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| program | `Eff` (`Program/Eff.lean`) | `binders.json` → `LayerView` | `cataFam`, unique by `hom_eq_cata_eff` |
| type | `Ty` (`Program/Ty.lean`, 20 constructors) | its generated family description | `cata_ty` (`Program/Fold.lean`) |
| term | `Term` (`Machine/Term.lean`) | generated | `cata_term` |
| value | `Store.Val` | its inductive; `Kind`/`Shape` classify it | `cata_val`; `Canonical` gives exact embeddings |
| schema carrier | `Representation` | its inductive | embeddings from `Ty` (row 6) |
| run | `List Command`, the free monoid on `Command` | the `Runner` group | the monoid action (§5, K5) |

TypeScript syntax (vendored) and LCNF (Lean's) are external sorts, reached by the printer and
reader and by `translateClosure`.

At a fixed input and budget policy, observing and stepping a state gives a coalgebraic view,
`S → Ω × S^Command`. That view does not make a state stored data. The journal acts by replay:
`replay_unique` proves the action unique from its empty, append and singleton equations, not that
different command words give different machines. `journal_replays` reconstructs a run, including
the journal it keeps. Serialization and resumption need their own contracts.

**Value fits type.** The runtime has one executable check, `Val.hasTy`, and no types in values.
The proof side has one judgment, `StrongValue`; replacing it with one constructor-complete
membership judgment over the actual encoding is proposed (row 96, open). Declared types of handles come from
creation evidence and the checker, not from values (row 97). Anything else that checks a value
against a type is a leak by §6.

## 5. Arrows: five kinds and what each owes

| Kind | Shape | Obligation | Proved instances |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1 fold | `cataFam alg : F → A` | being an algebra; uniqueness is free | the generated algebras; the checker is one `Except`-valued fold |
| K2 exact embedding | `write : A → F`, `read : F → Option A` | total on its domain; `read (write a) = some a`; `read v = some a → v ≡ write a` modulo a named normaliser | `Canonical` (`ofVal_toVal`, `ofVal_exact`); `read_print`, `read_exact` on the readable domain |
| K3 simulation | two behaviours, one observation, on a named fragment | the fragment named by exclusion or policy; the observation named | `run_eq_meaning` on `Straight`; `loopAgreement` on `Looped`; `run_eq_ref` at the empty table |
| K4 elaboration | `Src → Except Refusal F` | the refusal is located and complete: `explain = none ↔ wellTyped` | `explain_none_iff`, `authoring_scoped`, `open_total` |
| K5 monoid action | `List Command × S → S` | `replay_unique`, `journal_replays` | both |

A hand traversal that is not a fold is an exemption listed by name by `#traversal_census`
(`docs/core/traversal-census.md`). Two folds agree when their algebras do; no pairwise agreement
proof is written. A read without exactness is a widening, not an embedding. A simulation is never
called "equivalent" without its observation.

## 6. Coherence, composition, generation

**Coherence is counted per sort.** The principle allows one free object, plus any number of K2
embeddings with all three laws, plus folds, which are views rather than representations.
Anything else is a leak. The census is owned by `docs/core/coherence-principle.md` and
`docs/core/traversal-census.md`.

**Composition at `Eff` is scope-correct, not raw.** For a signature and a fixed context Γ,
programs are checked at Γ ++ [A] with answer B and an error and service grade. Variables are
absolute positions, and a successful bind appends its answer. The proposed operations are:

```text
idAt Γ          := succeed (var Γ.length)
composeAt Γ p q := bind p (q.weaken Γ.length)
```

- **Typing closes.** It is derived from `HasTy.bind` and `hasTy_weaken`, with the error join by
  `Ty.join` and requirements by union.
- **Raw bind is not categorical composition.** Well-scoped pure examples return different values
  after raw reassociation.
- **The laws are future work.** Identity and associativity are to be proved for `composeAt` at a
  named meaning, over fitting environments and stores.
- **Not yet a theorem.** A category or graded Freyd structure remains a proposed organization.
  The witnesses are in `docs/research/2026-09-19-critique-response.md` §2.

**Generation is a fixed point.** Stage 0 is the tables (`binders.json`, `manifest.json`, the
template table, `cases-policy.json`); stage 1 is the generated Lean. The committed tree must be a
fixed point of the generator (`check-gen`). Every generated declaration is a fold or an embedding
of §5, which keeps the generated sugar inside the proofs.

## 7. Evidence discipline

- Every claim names its theorem or its finite probe. A finite check is reported as one.
- The trust ceiling is `[propext, Quot.sound]` for every `Effect4.*` and `Test.*` declaration.
- Runtime coverage is quoted only from `scripts/report-effect-runtime-coverage.sh`.
- A refusal is located. A gap is written down with its row, never hidden behind a `True`.
- Probes and receipts live in `docs/research/` as evidence; the authority documents cite them.
